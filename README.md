# Google-Pagerank
Super simple directed graph input to calculate PageRank based on Google-PageRank

To run this program
1. Save the program to an easily locatable destination 
2. Open terminal or command prompt depending on your platform
3. Type: python3 <filename>.py where filename is pagerank if you did not alter

If you wish to change the input, you must edit the code directly and follow the steps 1-3 
There is no user input functionality

Note: This is not how Google calculates PageRank<return>
      They have many more complex algorithms for ranking pages; this is probably one of the <return> 
      basic ones
      
The code is based on:
Newman, Mark E. J. Networks: An Introduction. Oxford: Oxford U, 2015. Print.
Chapter 7.4
